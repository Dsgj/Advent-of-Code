# Advent of Code 2025 - Solutions & Visualizations

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

Each day includes a TypeScript solution and an interactive HTML/JS visualization to demonstrate the algorithm.

## Project Structure

For each day (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, ...), you will find:

- **`solution.ts`**: The TypeScript logic solving Part 1 and Part 2.
- **`visualization.html`**: A standalone interactive web page visualizing the problem and solution.
- **`input.txt`**: My specific puzzle input.
- **`exampleInput.txt`**: The example input provided in the problem description.

## How to Run

### Solutions

To run the solution for a specific day, use `ts-node`:

```bash
npx ts-node DayXX/solution.ts
```

### Visualizations

Simply open the `visualization.html` file in your web browser. No build server is required for the visualizations; they are self-contained.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can view the live visualizations here:
[**Advent of Code 2025 - Visualization Portal**](https://dsgj.github.io/Advent-of-Code/)

The root URL loads the **Project Portal** ([`index.html`](https://github.com/Dsgj/Advent-of-Code/blob/main/index.html)) which links to all daily solutions.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project demonstrates the capabilities of modern AI in software development.

- **IDE**: Antigravity
- **Models**:
  - **Gemini 3 Pro** (High)
  - **Claude Opus 4.5** (Thinking)

The code, visualizations, and documentation in this repository were generated through a pair-programming workflow between the user and these AI models within the Antigravity environment.
